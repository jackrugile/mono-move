DESCRIPTION
	Mono Move

	Inspired by classic browser-based games of the past, Mono Move is a single control, gravity switching, rage inducing, death tallying obstacle course. It was created using the web based tech of JavaScript/Canvas.

	Are you ready for nine levels of frustration? You will die. Like, a lot.
